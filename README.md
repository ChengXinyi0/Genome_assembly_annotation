try update, but not easy
Did it! ðŸ¥³
In the assembly result: 
Add result of QUAST: with reference and without reference => used to decide which assembly to use in the group
Add result of comparing: canu and flye with reference and with each other, but the figure of canu vs reference and canu vs flye seems the same...
