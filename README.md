# assembly_annotation
**dadada**
try update, but not easy <br>
### Did it! ğŸ¥³<br>
In the assembly result: <br>
Add result of QUAST: with reference and without reference => used to decide which assembly to use in the group<br>
Add result of comparing: canu and flye with reference and with each other, but the figure of canu vs reference and canu vs flye seems the same...<br>
